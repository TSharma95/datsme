                            order to sign up for a Free Trial, you may need to provide us with your preferred Payment
                            Method. As soon as you submit your payment details, your Free Trial will begin. You will not be
                            charged until 24 hours prior to the Free Trial expiry.

                            If You don't cancel a monthly or annual subscription before the end of the trial period (free or
                            otherwise), the Company will collect the full payment for the subscription (monthly or annual)
                            after the trial period ends. For instance, for an annual subscription with a seven (7) days
                            trial, the full payment will be collected on the eighth (8) day of the trial's start date, and
                            the subsequent payment for the annual subscription will be collected on the three hundred and
                            sixty-sixth (366) day of the trial's start date.
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            If an error occurs when collecting the first payment after the free trial has ended for monthly
                            or annual subscriptions that started with a free trial, then access to the subscription will be
                            removed immediately, and the Company will attempt to collect the first payment within seven (7)
                            days of the charge date. If Company is still not able to collect the first payment within seven
                            (7) days of the charge date, then Company will waive the right to charge that missed first
                            payment, will cancel that subscription, and will not attempt to collect any future payments on
                            that subscription. If the first payment is collected within seven (7) days of the charge date,
                            then access to the subscription will be re-granted, the subscription will be kept active, and
                            Company will start collecting recurring payments on that subscription accordingly.

                            Free Trial is about to end, but we do not guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately
                            your responsibility to know when the Free Trial will end if you decide you do not want to become
                            a paying Paid Subscriptions user after the Free Trial period.

                            If you decide you do not want to become a paying Paid Subscriptions user, you must cancel your
                            subscription at least 24 hours before the end of the Free Trial period. Depending on the
                            applicable Paid Subscription, you may lose access as soon as you cancel or at the end of the
                            Free Trial period. Once you have canceled your Free Trial and received confirmation, you cannot
                            resume the Free Trial period even if it was not used for the entire duration of the offer.

                            specific feature or content will be available for the entire Free Trial period. The rates in
                            effect when you sign up for the Free Trial will be the same when the Free Trial ends unless we

                            any Free Trial offer, your access to the Paid Subscriptions during the Free Trial, or any of
                            these terms without notice and with no liability. You may not sign up for more than one Free
                            Trial of a given Paid Subscription at the same time, and we reserve the right to limit your
                            ability to take advantage of multiple Free Trials.

                            <strong>Termination or Cancellation of Paid Subscriptions - </strong>You can manage your
                            subscription, cancel it, or turn off automatic renewals through your Apple App Store, or Google
                            Play Store account. If you choose to cancel your subscription, it will remain active until the
                            end of your current subscription period.
                        </span>
                        <span><strong>Please note that uninstalling Datsme will not cancel your

                        <span>
                            Once you have canceled your Paid Subscription and received confirmation, no other changes can be
                            made to your account. The cancellation of a Paid Subscription will go into effect at the end of
                            your current billing cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the Paid Subscription
                            through the remainder of such billing cycle. For example, if you are billed on a monthly basis
                            and cancel during a given month, you will be charged for the entirety of that month and maintain
                            access to the Paid Subscription through the end of that month.

                            If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Paid Subscriptions, we may make
                            reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable
                            or terminate your access to the Paid Subscriptions (and may do so without notice).

                            <strong>Fee Changes - </strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change
                            our prices for Paid Subscriptions at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such
                            pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Paid Subscription and/or
                            by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you can cancel
                            the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the change going into effect.

                            terms and conditions of the specific code. To redeem a discount or coupon code, log in to the
                            applicable Service and enter the applicable code to take advantage of the relevant promotion.
                            All discounts, gifts, and coupon codes can only be applied when subscribing to Paid
                            Subscriptions, and to accounts not already subscribed to Paid Subscriptions. Discount, coupon,
                            and gift codes cannot be combined with any other cash-off price, sales, promotion, or coupon,
                            and cannot be exchanged, refunded, replaced, or redeemed for cash or payment of accounts.

                            A payment method may be required to redeem a discount or coupon code. It is your own
                            responsibility to use a discount, coupon, or gift code before it expires, and expired codes
                            cannot be refunded or extended. It is also your responsibility to terminate the Paid
                            Subscription before the end of a free or discounted period if you do not want to continue with a
                            Paid Subscription at the regular price. The terms and conditions of a specific discount, coupon,
                            or gift code may include additional restrictions on its use, including but not limited to the
                            type of plan, duration of free or discounted Paid Subscription, coupon validity dates, and/or
                            purchase quantities. Datsme reserves the right to cancel discounts and coupon promotions at any
                            time.

                        Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
                        that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the
                        provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You
                        agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
                        out of or related to the use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1)
                        year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this
                        agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
                        administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject
                        to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained
                        in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of
                        Datsme, but Datsme may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without
                        restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal
                        or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may
                        also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying
                        notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
