                            Location is the central tenet of the Datsme app. Your geographical location is only collected
                            with your consent. In fact, you will be asked to authorize the collection and processing of your

                            Messages are sent and stored on DATSME's servers, to provide the Service to allow Users to have
                            a conversation with their friends. Messages and images are strictly private and only implicate
                            the Users involved.

                            Moreover, Messages are strictly private and are not accessible to other Users who are not
                            involved in the conversation, nor to any third party.

                            DATSME does not encourage users to share data that can be perceived as sensitive over messages.
                            Regardless, if a User decides to share such information, it is deemed to have been “clearly made
                            public” by the User who shared it. In such a case, our organization shall not be held
                            responsible under Section 43A (or any other section) of the I.T. Amendment Act for the
                            information shared by the user.

                            The Application lets you search for people on the basis of preferences, interests, hobbies, and
                            other similar TAGS offered in your profile. You may also search for people on the basis of their

                            public by the users themselves in the form of TAGS which are displayed on their profiles. You
                            can choose to modify/update these TAGS in the Application by visiting your profile.

                    <p>
                        DATSME does not collect or process any banking data. Google's Play Store has opted to refrain from
                        sending certain types of data to mobile applications, which includes any banking and financial
                        information. This data is collected and processed solely by the above platforms, and DATSME does not
                        have the option of changing this payment method. The only information exchanged between DATSME and
                        Google's Play Store is technical data that does not allow us to identify you (for example, a
                        transaction number), and is used to validate transactions.
